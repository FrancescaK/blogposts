# NeDB: a lightweight Javascript database using MongoDB's API

Wait, what? Is the goal just to verify Atwood's Law ("Everything that _can_ be written in Javascript _will_ be written in Javascript")? Certainly not!


<a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb">NeDB</a> is a lightweight database written entirely in Javascript, and that implements the MongoDB API. This is the tool you want when you need a way to store and query data in a clean and structured way, but don't need the power of a full-blown solution such as MongoDB.
