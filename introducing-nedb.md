# NeDB: a lightweight Javascript database using MongoDB's API

Wait, what? Is the goal just to verify Atwood's Law ("Everything that _can_ be written in Javascript _will_ be written in Javascript")? Certainly not!


Sometimes you need database functionality but want to avoid the constraints that come with installing a full-blown solution. Maybe you're writing a desktop application with Node Webkit, and don't want to have your users install MongoDB. Or maybe you are writing a Node service or web application that needs to be easily packageable. That's when you need <a href="https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb">NeDB</a>.

NeDB is a lightweight database written entirely in Javascript, and that implements the well-known and loved MongoDB API.
